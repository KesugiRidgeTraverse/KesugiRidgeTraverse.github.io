  <h1 class="post-title">Race Rules</h1>

<section class="post-content">
<ol>
<li>All racers must be signed in at the Little Coal Creek Trailhead by 8:45 a.m.. Race start is at 9 a.m. We will NOT meet on race day at Byers Lake. Carpooling to Little Coal Creek is recommended. Please be aware of State Park parking and camping fees. If you stay at Byers Lake or in the area the night before, you are responsible for your transportation to the start.</li>
<li>Mandatory pre-race meeting 8:45 a.m. Bibs need to be picked up by this time.</li>
<li>Bibs can not be transferred.</li>
<li>There is no early race start.</li>
<li>No one under 18 at the day of race is allowed to sign up.</li>
<li>All racers must check in with officials the morning of the race at Little Coal Creek, even if you picked up your bib the night before at Byers Lake Campground. We need to know who is starting so we can keep track of you.</li>
<li>Time cut-offs:</li>
<li>Full Traverse finish cut-off is 9 hours, or 6 p.m.</li>
<li>Full Traverse racers must reach the checkpoint just beyond Ermine Hill Trail junction by 1 p.m. (4 hours). Any racer arriving after 1 p.m. will be disqualified and their race bib pulled. Those who do not make the cut-off must take the Ermine Hill Trail down to the road. If someone chooses to go on despite this rule, they may be denied future Kesugi entry. Organizers will ensure a ride back to the finish from the Ermine Hill Trailhead.</li>
<li>To receive an official finish, Half Traverse racers must arrive within 4 hours.</li>
<li>There are no aid stations. There will be race official at midway and a trail sweep, but no refreshments provided on the course. You are responsible for your own food and water. Drink water along the course at your own risk. There are plenty of available streams, one of which is named Giardia Creek. Friends or family can meet you at Ermine Hill with gear and food.</li>
<li>Beware of wildlife and please do not wear headphones. Bears have been observed during the race and are common in this area. Moose are also prevalent.</li>
<li>Mandatory gear includes the following: windbreaker, long-sleeved shirt, pants or tights, hat, gloves, sustenance and water bottle. Please don&rsquo;t go &ldquo;Crow Pass style&rdquo; and duct tape everything together around your waist, thereby making it difficult to access. Also bring legitimate gear: no Tyvek painter&rsquo;s suit for your windbreaker and pants layer!</li>
<li>Stick to the trail and don&rsquo;t travel overland. Please do not cut the switchbacks. This especially applies to the Cascade Trail that heads down to Byers Lake.</li>
<li>Do not litter! And take care of your trash so it accidentally doesn&rsquo;t become litter.</li>
<li>Knowledge of the trail is vital. All racers are strongly advised to have traveled the course prior to race day.</li>

<section class="post-content">


<p>Point to point, starting at Little Coal Creek Trailhead and finishing at Byers Lake Campground. The course is approximately 30 miles. Good descriptions can be found in the hiking guides 55Ways to the Wilderness (5th edition) by Helen Nienhueser &amp; John Wolfe Jr. and Hiking Alaska by Dean Littlepage.</p>

<h3 id="a-brief-course-description">A brief course description</h3>

<p>Starting around 1400 feet, the Full Traverse trail (nearly 30 miles) climbs steadily to above tree line to a high, alpine ridge. The trail is marked with cairns in most places. There will also be flagging and/or pin flags in some key sections. About halfway, the Ermine Hill Trail comes in from the right (elevation 1,500 feet). After the junction, the trail again climbs above tree line until it descends 5 miles to Byers Lake via the Cascade Trail.</p>

<p>NOTE: The suspension bridge one mile from the finish has been removed so participants must wade across Byers Creek. It is only about 25 feet across and the water is slow-moving but potentially thigh- to waist-deep.</p>

<p>The course will finish in the Byers Lake campground with food, drinks and awards. See pictures below for a couple of good visual directions.
The Half Traverse trail (about 15.5 miles) follows the above route to its finish just uphill from the Ermine Hill Trail junction. Participants will then return 3.5 miles down the Ermine Hill Trail to the Parks Highway at their leisure. A shuttle will then return them to Byers Lake Campground.</p>

<h4 id="please-be-aware">Please be aware</h4>

<p>This is not a course for beginning trail runners. There are significant climbs, tricky descents and difficult terrain. If you have never traveled the course, we strongly encourage you to do so before signing up. The trail will only have minimal markings, so familiarity with it will be important. Please do not overestimate your abilities! The weather has been inclement in past races, with cold temperatures, rain, snow, wind and low visibility occurring. The time and effort expended at Kesugi is comparable to running up to 2 marathons. If you are a road runner but have never tackled trail running, Kesugi is not for you. Steady running with some power hiking on the hills will be necessary to make the time cut-offs.</p>
