<h3 id="a-brief-course-description">A brief course description</h3>

<p>Located in Denali State Park, the Kesugi Ridge Traverse course starts at the Little Coal Creek Trailhead (Parks Highway Mile 163.9) and finishes 30 miles later at Byers Lake Campground (Mile 147).</p>

<p>Starting at an elevation of 1,400 feet, the trail climbs steadily in the opening four miles to an alpine ridge with a high point of 3,500 feet. The trail is marked with cairns in most places.</p>

<p>When visibility allows, views of the Eldridge Glacier and Denali, the largest peak in North America, are prominent.</p>

<p>Nearly halfway, the Ermine Hill Trail comes in from the right (elevation 2,300 feet). The <strong>Kesugi Ridge Half Traverse</strong> (about 14.2 miles) ends a short distance uphill from this junction at a rock formation called &ldquo;The Doors.&rdquo; After their race, Half Traverse participants take the Ermine Hill Trail 3.5 miles back to the Parks Highway at their leisure. The Ermine Hill Trailhead is at Mile 156.5. A shuttle will return runners to Byers Lake Campground.</p>

<p>Beyond &ldquo;The Doors&rdquo;, the <strong>Full Traverse</strong> descends to  1,500 feet before it climbs back above treeline, passes Skinny Lake and reaches almost 3,000 feet at Golog Point near Mile 20. Around Mile 25, the course begins a long, switchbacked descent to Byers Lake via the Cascade Trail. The course ends in the Byers Lake Campground (elevation 800 feet) with food, drinks and awards. The total elevation gain is 6,200 feet and elevation loss is 6,800 feet.
Be aware this is not a race for beginners. Long-distance trail running experience is a must. Familiarity with the course is important. Past races have featured rain, snow, cold, and limited visibility. Sections of the course are extremely technical and can be swampy.</p>

<div id="rules">
  <h1 class="post-title">Race Rules</h1>

<section class="post-content race rules">
<ol>
<li>All racers must be signed in at the Little Coal Creek Trailhead by <strong>8:45 a.m.</strong> Race start is at 9 a.m. We will NOT meet on race day at Byers Lake. Carpooling to Little Coal Creek is necessary. If you stay at Byers Lake or in the area the night before, you are responsible for your transportation to the start.</li>
<li>Mandatory pre-race meeting <strong>8:45 a.m.</strong> Bibs need to be picked up by this time.</li>
<li>Bibs can not be transferred.</li>
<li>All racers must check in with officials the morning of the race at Little Coal Creek, even if you picked up your bib the night before at Byers Lake Campground. We need to know who is starting so we can keep track of you.</li>
<li>Time cut-offs:

<ul>
<li>Full Traverse finish cut-off is 9 hours.</li>
<li>Full Traverse racers must reach the checkpoint just beyond Ermine Hill Trail junction within 4 hours. Any racer arriving thereafter must take the Ermine Hill Trail down to the Parks Highway. If someone continues despite this rule, they may be denied future Kesugi entry. Organizers will ensure a ride back to Byers Lake from the Ermine Hill Trailhead.</li>
<li>To receive an official finish, Half Traverse racers must arrive within 4 hours.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>There are no aid stations.</strong> There will be race officials at the midway checkpoint and a trail sweep, but no refreshments provided on the course. You are responsible for your own food and fluids. Drink water along the course at your own risk or bring a water purification device. There are plenty of available streams (one is named Giardia Creek). Friends and family can meet you at Ermine Hill Checkpoint with gear, food and drink.</li>
<li>Beware of wildlife and please do not wear headphones. Bears have been observed during the race and are common in this area. Consider bringing bear spray. Moose are also prevalent.</li>
<li>Mandatory gear includes the following: windbreaker, long-sleeved shirt, pants or tights, hat, gloves, sustenance, race bib, and water bottle. Please don’t go “Crow Pass style” and duct tape everything together around your waist, thereby making it difficult to access. Also, bring legitimate gear: no Tyvek painters suits!</li>
<li>Stick to the trail and don’t travel overland. Please do not cut the switchbacks. This especially applies to the Cascade Trail that heads down to Byers Lake.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t litter!</li>
<li>Knowledge of the trail is vital. All racers are strongly advised to have traveled the course prior to race day.</li>
</ol>
