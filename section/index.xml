      <description>Bibs can be picked up at Byers Lake Headquarters from 5-9 p.m. the night before the race, or at Little Coal Creek Trailhead on race morning We will NOT meet on race day at Byers Lake. Participants are responsible for their transportation to the Little Coal Creek start and carpooling or getting dropped off is imperative due to limited parking. All participants must sign in at Little Coal Creek by (even if they picked up their bib the night before) so that we know how many start the event.</description>

      <description>How will the race be different in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic? What mitigation measures will be implemented?  Kesugi is a long race in the backcountry with minimal support, precisely the kind of event that can be held safely during the pandemic. That said, many measures will be taken to limit group sizes, promote social distancing, ensure adequate sanitization and encourage responsible hygiene. There will be two wave starts 30 minutes apart.</description>
