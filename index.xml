      <description>What does K’esugi mean?  It means the Ancient One in Dena’ina. Traditionally the area was used as caribou hunting grounds.
 Who are the two Dave Johnstons?  Dave Johnston the Elder (of Minus 148 Degrees fame) helped build the original trail in the mid-1970s, along with Pete Robinson, George Menard and the Youth Conservation Corps. It took 3-4 years to put in the basic trail. Brian Okonek had the idea to use Kesugi’s lateral moraine instead of some of the surrounding high country.</description>
