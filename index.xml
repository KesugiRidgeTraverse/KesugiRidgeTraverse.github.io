      <description>How will the race be different in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic? What mitigation measures will be implemented?  Kesugi is a long race in the backcountry with minimal support, precisely the kind of event that can be held safely during the pandemic. That said, many measures will be taken to limit group sizes, promote social distancing, ensure adequate sanitization and encourage responsible hygiene. There will be two wave starts 30 minutes apart.</description>
